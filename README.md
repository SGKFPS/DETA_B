# DETA_B

This repo contains a damned down version of the Storage Optimization routine.

It is devided into 3 steps:

* Preperation
* Optimization
* Post-Processing

Scripts: landlord and compile will generate the landlord supply profiles and compile them with residential ones

You use the batch file to run the sensitivity analysis. 

post displays some basic post processing operation used for this cycle.

The only unusual requirement is: Dask
